Code for San Jose received some welcome local coverage in Metro News last week.  

The article, by Jennifer Wadsworth, captures our organization with a great title: [“Code for San Jose Converts Raw Data into Civic-Driven Missions.”](http://www.sanjoseinside.com/2014/08/21/code-for-san-jose-converts-raw-data-into-civic-driven-missions/) The story includes quotes from Code for San Jose members Kalen Gallagher, Daniel McCue, Emily Ramos and Michelle Thong and also highlights Code for San Jose projects Open DSJ and CycleSafe.  

As you can see in the photo below, the article also features a great photo of Nancy Donnell and Joe Iloreta!  

The article also puts Code for San Jose’s work in the context of the broader open data and civic tech movements, citing projects in Oakland, San Francisco and Palo Alto, and quoting VTA’s Cody Kraatz.
