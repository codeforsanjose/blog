What can 40 citizens hack in 7 hours? Quite a lot, it turns out.  

May 31, 2014 was a good day for civic hacking across the nation, but especially for Code for San Jose. We held our first hackathon, a major milestone for our 10-week old organization.  

Our event was held in the oldest and most revered of civic institutions — the library. Our participants ranged in age from teenagers to retired citizens, with expertise in design, development, education, law, project management and other fields.  

The main projects that emerged from the day were:  
* [CycleSafe](http://hackforchange.org/projects/cyclesafe/), an app for reporting bike hazards,  
* [OpenDSJ](http://codeforsanjose.com/opendsj/), a visualization of San Jose mayoral campaign contributions  
* InnovateSJ Map, showing tech startups and job opportunities in San Jose  
* [VTA transit network analysis](http://pages.ianrees.net/maps/vta/) for the South Bay

After all the hard work of our participants, we were excited to have some special visitors from VTA, the San Jose City Council,the Office of Mayor Chuck Reed, Code for America and Hack for Change join us for final presentations.  

Thanks to [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/) for sponsoring food and beverage to fuel our participants, and to [Hack for Change](http://hackforchange.org/) for providing awesome swag.
