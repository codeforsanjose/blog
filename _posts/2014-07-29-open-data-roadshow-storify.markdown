On July 10, 2014, the California Open Data Roadshow brought together local public, private and nonprofit leaders with open data leaders from across the country to kickstart the conversation on open data in San Jose.  

Code for San Jose was one of three local event organizers, in collaboration with the City of San José and [Silicon Valley Talent Partnership](http://www.svtpca.org/). The event was sponsored by San Jose-based software company [Apigee](http://apigee.com/) and nonpartisan nonprofit organization [California Forward](http://www.cafwd.org/). Other key partners included the [Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development](http://business.ca.gov/) and [The Tech Museum of Innovation](http://www.thetech.org/).  

In the introductory remarks, state and local government leaders set the state and local context for open data.  

Two panel discussions, on “Making Open Data a Reality” and “Collaborating Across the Civic Tech Ecosystem,” featured open data experts and thought leaders from local government, civic start-ups and nonprofit organizations, including Code for San Jose’s own Kalen Gallagher.
